# rpi-radio
A Python script to play webstream-radio

This is based on

https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Radio/

The license is CC BY-NC-SA.

I refactored the original to support:

* radio streams in a separate file
* keyboard controls
* Use button of rotary encoder for channel switch
* Use rotary encoder for volume
* some cleanup
